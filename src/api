SDL used in SG2D:

SDL_lowScancode
SDL_highScancode (can be replaced by a generic function to get any key press or array of currently pressed keys)
SDL_Rect
SDL_SetTextureAlphaMod
SDL_SetTextureBlendMode
SDL_RenderCopyEx
SDL_mutex and related functions (easily replacable)
SDL_Delay
SDL_thread and related functions (easily replacable)
SDL_Cursor and SDL_SetCursor (possibly not cross-platform)
SDL_Surface (this can be any buffer that can be turned into a texture)

SDL used in current platform layer headers:
init flags
SDL_Renderer
SDL_Window
SDL_Texture
SDL_Point
SDL_RendererFlip (is this actually used?)
SDL_Color
SDL_Keycode (should be easily replacable, right now probably everything used is convertible to char)
TCPsocket
Mix_Chunk

breaking changes for neon needle so far:
insec takes a Rect not an SDL_Rect

TODO 
headers should not include anything in modules like in BILE or OSAL

replace all #pragma once with #ifndef #define #endif
